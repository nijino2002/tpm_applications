add -Wno-error=format to AM_CFLAGS in libtpm/lib/Makefile

add following to /etc/profile
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/linaro/dev/trousers/src/tspi/.libs:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export TESTSUITE_OWNER_SECRET="111111"
export TESTSUITE_SRK_SECRET="111111"

export TPM_SERVER_NAME=localhost

when you compile tsstestsuite, each Makefile must be added -lcrypto to LIBS as well as the Makefiles in each sub-directories. Makefile in highlevel directory must be added -lcrypto -lpthread to LIBS. The name of testsuite directory must be name as "testsuite". Before running tsstests.sh, make sure running command "source /etc/profile" in terminal to guarantee the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH available.

EK and SRK must be configured via tpm_createek and tpm_takeownership of tpm-tools, otherwise, error TSS_E_PS_KEY_NOTFOUND will rises.
